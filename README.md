# Neural Style Transfer

This project is an implementation of the the paper "A Neural Algorithm for Artistic Style" by Gatys et al. and can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)


## Usage

You should start cloning this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/droid2299/Neural-Style-Transfer.git
    
Next go to any browser and search:

    $ https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/vgg16/
    
And download the vgg16_weights.npz. We will be using this pretrained model's weights in our implementation 
    
Next place the file in the vgg directory within the project.

Run the Neural Style Transfer.ipynb file
